# VBVagrant
Installing Virtual Box and Vagrant

The purpose of this project to develop an auditing tool that will compare/contast user permissions to a list of authorized permissions in order to speed up security auditing of access control systems.

Additionally, by leveraging GitHub toolset along with Slack and others, I will be able to learn common project devleopment strategies used among IT teams.

The team is using issues and pull requests in order to identify tasks to be performed.  Also, Projects are used to group these tasks into logical buckets and prioritize what we are working on during the next period.  Lastly, the Wiki is used to create documentation and capture knowledge for the project.
